# Zoo Management System

Welcome to the Zoo Management System! This Python application is designed to manage the information related to animals and plants within a zoo environment. 

## File Structure

Ensure the following files are located in the same directory:

- `zoo.py`: The main executable script.
- `fauna.py`: Contains classes and functions related to animals.
- `flora.py`: Contains classes and functions related to plants.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Files**: Make sure you have the three Python files (`zoo.py`, `fauna.py`, and `flora.py`) saved in a directory of your choice.

2. **Check Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read and write files in the directory where the scripts are located. This will help avoid issues with file access.

3. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - On Windows, press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
   - On macOS/Linux, open your terminal application.

4. **Navigate to the Directory**: Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where the files are located. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/directory



5. Execute the Script: Run the main application by typing
python3 zoo.py
